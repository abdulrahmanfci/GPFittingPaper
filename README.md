# COMPARING BEHAVIOR OF DISEASES USING SIMULATION BASED INFERENCE
This code is for GP fitting paper preprint using Python as a programming language and GPFLow library to fit the simulated data.

## Abstract
Computational models provide an option to help decision makers understand disease’s behavior and ultimately
possible interventions. One of the main aspects to study infectious disease is the capability of observing its
behavior while rest of the factors remain constant. What if we could observe the behavior of two different
diseases while they arise from the same initial conditions (i.e. digital twins). FRED software provide
an option with a geo-spatial perspective as FRED has synthetic population data based on real US census
data. Having synthetic data provide a standard ground which allows us to get comparable results from
different diseases. In this paper we show (with Gaussian process help) that infectious diseases’ spreadness
are different though they started from the very same initial population conditions. We believe this proposed
method could help in developing a better way to understand infectious diseases.
